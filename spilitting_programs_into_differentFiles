main.cpp contains the following:

#include <iostream>     //std::cout
#include <string>       //std::string
#include <vector>       //std::vector
#include <algorithm>    //std::sort
#include <array>        //std::array

// splitting programs in different files
// #include <cmath> allows users to use sqrt function
// c++ uses a lot of predefined libraries of functions. At work, we use to make our own libraries for the command uplink system for solar pointing attitude control system of the sounding rockets or allow scientiest to point the payload or experiment at a specific region on the solar disk. All this was possible through the use of a command uplink computer, which was designed & configured using flight software and libraries including functions written in c++. cmath in this case is a header file. header <cmath> contains all these lists of math operations and trasformations. http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cmath/
// so make sure to call #include <math.h> or #include <cmath>

// Notes:
// standard libraries are #include <> form and the used defined library files are #include "something.h"

// splitting programs into different files:
// steps:
// 1. main() function
// 2. header file called average.h
// 3. code implementation file called average.cpp

#include "averages.h" // this is the header file
